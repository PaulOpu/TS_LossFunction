He found similar sound patterns for \"yanny\" and \"laurel.\" Because the sound is not very clear, it leaves room for interpreting. That is where the mind tricks come in.\\n\\nNina Kraus is a scientist who studies sound at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She says the way we hear depends on what we have heard before. As an example, she shared two sound recordings. On the first one, you just hear noise. On the second one, you hear words.\\n\\nYet if you listen to the first one again, you will hear the words. Your mind learns to listen for them.\\xa0\\n\\nDouglas Beck works for a company that makes hearing aids.\\xa0He says that several things change the way people listen to the same sound. What people remember and expect make a difference, he says. Other factors can play a role too. One example is whether someone has musical training.\\n\\nYour Mind Fills In The Gaps\\n-\\n\\nWhen a sound is not clear, your mind fills in any missing pieces, Story says. It uses\\xa0what you expect to hear.\\xa0\\n\\nBecause the sound in the recording is not clear, it is uncertain. Your mind fills in the rest.\\n\\nStory says people were prepared to hear \"laurel\" or \"yanny.\" They may have decided what to listen for before the sound was even played, he says. They might not know that, though. People should not know anything ahead of time. That is how to really test how someone hears the sound, he says.\\xa0\\n\\nThe sound clip keeps spreading online.

When listening to the second, you hear a clear phrase.\\n\\nHowever, if you go back and listen to the first clip again, you\\'ll hear that phrase.\\n\\n\"Part of the answer is the difference between listening and hearing,\" says Douglas Beck.
