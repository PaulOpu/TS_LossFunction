Amid conflict, a show of solidarity among Jews and Muslims in U.S.

A protest by Palestinians on the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel turned deadly on Monday. Israel's security forces opened fire on protesters, killing at least 60 people and injuring thousands.

The Palestinians were protesting the United States moving its embassy, or government building, in Israel. The embassy was once in Tel Aviv. President Donald Trump asked to move the embassy to Jerusalem. This holy city is often fought over by Muslims and Jews.

Both the protesters and soldiers were driven by history and politics in one of the world's most complicated conflicts. Yet, in spite of the fighting, Jews and Muslims in the United States have been forming alliances to build trust and solidarity in a way that has not been done before.

Efforts To Learn About Each Other's Faiths
Muslims and Jews have sent members into mosques and synagogues to learn about each other's faiths. They made a joint trip to tour civil rights sites in the South. Leaders of the groups said the challenging world events have provided the catalyst for the outreach efforts.

It started with the rise in hate crimes against members of both communities. A U.S. travel ban keeping people from Muslim majority countries from visiting, became another issue to join together on. The violence on Monday proved yet again why this is important.

"If there's ever a time to talk, it's now," said Aziza Hasan, the executive director for the Los Angeles-based group NewGround.

NewGround has provided leadership training programs for professionals from the two communities. One recent event was a backyard supper in Los Angeles. Guests discussed their religions' approach to death. This included what rituals are involved and how the grieving process unfolds. Participants were moved by similarities in the traditions of their two faiths.

"Some people were on the verge of tears as they dug into it," said Hasan.

Perhaps the most high-powered of the outreach efforts is the Muslim Jewish Advisory Council. It was started two years ago to work on expanding laws against hate crimes. Now, the council — an interfaith team of business, political and religious leaders — is launching a new initiative. It is sending Jewish members into mosques, where Muslims go to worship. It is also sending Muslims into synagogues, where Jews go to worship. The goal is to speak and listen in ways that break down walls.

Turning Crisis "Into An Opportunity For Peace"
Farooq Kathwari is the council co-chair. He said the violence along Gaza's border with Israel on Monday poses a test for the outreach project.

"We have to double our efforts to stay together," said Kathwari. "I hope and pray that this crisis does turn into an opportunity for peace."

Another ambitious group is the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom. It aims to bring together Jewish and Muslim women interested in learning about each other. Looking for new ways to combat bigotry, several dozen of the women traveled to the southern United States in April. They visited Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, visiting sites commemorating the civil rights movement.

"We want to learn how to speak out against hate," said co-founder Sheryl Olitzky, who is Jewish.

The other co-founder, Atiya Aftab, is an attorney who teaches Islamic law at Rutgers University. She described the bloodshed in Gaza as heartbreaking, yet said it would motivate the group's efforts.

"As people of faith we pray that we continue to see God's love and humanity in each other," she said.

A Show Of Unity Against Violence
For those looking to build bridges, there have been some inspiring efforts. In Germany, more than 2,000 people including Muslims and Jews put on Jewish skullcaps and took to the streets. They protested an anti-Semetic, or anti-Jewish, attack in Berlin. In the U.S., Muslim communities raised funds last year to help restore vandalized Jewish cemeteries. 

A measure making the penalty for violence against a religious group higher passed the House of Representatives in December. The Muslim Jewish Advisory Council hopes the goodwill generated from this federal legislation will boost outreach efforts. The bill is expected to pass in the other house of Congress, the Senate, with a majority as well.

The Muslim Jewish Advisory Council hopes to expand to other parts of the country. The groups can help stop or weaken "prejudice on both sides" through events and conversations specific to local concerns.

The Trump Factor
The joint efforts come as many Muslims say President Donald Trump's words and policies have led to increased threats and attacks against the community. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a civil rights group for Muslim-Americans. They said last month that "Trump's xenophobic rhetoric" has made it seem like it's OK to say bigoted things. Xenophobia is a fear of anything or person that appears foreign. CAIR says this has led to a 15 percent jump in reported anti-Muslim hate crimes last year. 

The advisory council's leaders avoid direct criticism of Trump. They argue that hate crimes have been on the rise for a while. They also say the country was polarized before Trump became president.

The Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom also approaches politically charged issues with caution.

Last week, with more fighting in the Middle East, the Sisterhood held a special meeting of its chapter leaders to provide training on how to address the conflict.

United Against "Acts Of Hate"
Both co-founders say the Sisterhood's mission has taken on extra urgency during Trump's presidency.

Since the election, Olitzky argues, there has been a "demonstrable increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim acts of hate." However, those acts of hate have brought the Jewish and Muslim communities together in new ways.

Muqtedar Khan is a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Delaware. He believes social and political conditions more likely to create solidarity between the two faiths. Especially with the youth.  

"They have common ground in seeking social justice in America," Khan said.
