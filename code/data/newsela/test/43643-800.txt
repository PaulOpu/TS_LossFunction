Amid conflict, a show of solidarity among Jews and Muslims in U.S.

A protest on the border of the Gaza Strip and Israel turned deadly Monday. The area itself is fought over by two groups of people, the Palestinians and the Israelis. The official religion of Israel is Judaism and most Israelis are Jewish. Most Palestinians are Muslim.

On Monday, a group of Palestinians was protesting that the United States was moving its embassy, or government building, in Israel. The embassy was once in Tel Aviv. President Donald Trump asked to move the embassy to Jerusalem. This holy city is often fought over by Muslims and Jews.

During the protests, soldiers opened fire on the protesters. At least 60 people were killed. Thousands more were injured. 

Despite the fighting, Jews and Muslims in the United States have been joining together. They are building trust and solidarity between the two communities.

Seeking A Better Understanding About Each Other
Muslims worship in mosques. Jews worship in synagogues. To build better relationships, they are visiting each other's house of worship. They are learning about all the things they have in common. They are not focusing on what makes them different. 

Leaders of the groups say this all started because of challenging world events. Hate crimes against Muslims and Jews have been going up. The U.S. government also tried to keep people from countries where most people are Muslim from being able to easily travel to the U.S. Both communities agreed these issues were wrong. So they decided to work together. 

"If there's ever a time to talk, it's now," said Aziza Hasan. She leads the Los Angeles-based group NewGround.

NewGround gives leadership training programs to the two communities. They hold events like dinners for people to get to know each other. One dinner was held in Los Angeles recently. The guests talked about death in their religion. They talked about what customs they do and how they grieve. People were so moved by the similarities between the two faiths.

"Some people were on the verge of tears as they dug into it," said Hasan.

Working To Prevent Crimes Of Hate
Another group working on building bonds is the Muslim Jewish Advisory Council. It was started two years ago. They work on expanding laws against hate crimes. The council is an interfaith team of business, political and religious leaders. They are also working to bring Muslims and Jews together.

Farooq Kathwari is the council co-chair. He said the violence along Gaza's border with Israel on Monday poses a test for the outreach project.

"We have to double our efforts to stay together," said Kathwari. "I hope and pray that this crisis does turn into an opportunity for peace."

Another group is the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom. It aims to bring together Jewish and Muslim women interested in learning about each other. Looking for new ways to combat bigotry, several dozen of the women traveled to southern United States in April. They visited Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, visiting sites commemorating the civil rights movement. 

"We want to learn how to speak out against hate," said co-founder Sheryl Olitzky. She is Jewish.

The other co-founder, Atiya Aftab, is Muslim. She described the bloodshed in Gaza as heartbreaking. Still, she said it would motivate the group's efforts.

"As people of faith we pray that we continue to see God's love and humanity in each other," she said.

Interfaith Efforts And The Trump Factor
For those looking to build bridges, there have been some inspiring efforts. In Germany, more than 2,000 people including Muslims and Jews put on Jewish skullcaps and took to the streets. They protested an anti-Semitic attack in Berlin. In the U.S., Muslim communities raised funds last year to help restore vandalized Jewish cemeteries. 

These efforts come as many Muslims say Trump's words and policies have led to increased threats and attacks against the community. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a civil rights group for Muslim-Americans. They said last month that Trump has said very hateful things about people of different religions and cultures. This makes other people think it is OK to do this. CAIR said that since Trump became president hate crimes against Muslims have gone up.

The interfaith groups try to keep away from political issues. 

Muqtedar Khan is a professor at the University of Delaware. He believes that today's political environment is more likely to unify the two faiths, young Muslims and young Jews.

"They have common ground in seeking social justice in America," Khan said.
