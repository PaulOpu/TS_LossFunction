Amid conflict, a show of solidarity among Jews and Muslims in U.S.

A protest on the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel became deadly Monday. The area is in the Middle East.

The land itself is fought over by two groups of people: the Palestinians and the Israelis. The official religion of Israel is Judaism. Most Israelis are Jewish. Most Palestinians are Muslim.

Embassy Move Sparks Protest In Israel
A group of Palestinians was protesting that the United States was moving its embassy. The embassy is a government building in Israel. It was in the city of Tel Aviv. Then, President Donald Trump asked to move it to Jerusalem. This is a holy city. Jerusalem is often fought over by Muslims and Jews.

During the protests, Israeli soldiers started shooting at protesters. At least 60 people were killed. Thousands of people were injured. 

Interfaith Efforts In The U.S.
In the United States, Jews and Muslims are trying to work together. They are not letting the fighting affect them. They want to build trust and unity between the two communities. This is very different from what is happening in the Middle East. 

Muslims worship in mosques. Jews worship in synagogues. To build better relationships, they are visiting each other's house of worship. They are learning about all the things they have in common. They are not focusing on what makes them different. 

Hate crimes against Muslims and Jews have been going up. This is something both communities agree is wrong. They have decided to work together.

Working To Know Each Other Better
Community leaders hope the violence on Monday won't stop their efforts. They want to work harder to keep working together.

One group doing this work is the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom. It is a group of Jewish and Muslim women. They get together to learn about each other. They also wanted to learn about how to fight against hate. They went on a trip to Southern states in the U.S. They visited important sites in the civil rights movement in April.

"We want to learn how to speak out against hate," said co-founder Sheryl Olitzky. She is Jewish.

The other co-founder, Atiya Aftab, is Muslim. She described the fighting in Gaza as heartbreaking. Still, she said it would motivate the group's efforts.

Common Ground
There have been some inspiring stories. In Germany, more than 2,000 people including Muslims and Jews put on Jewish skullcaps and took to the streets. These hats are what Jewish men wear. Together, the group protested an attack against Jews in Germany.

In the U.S., Muslim communities raised money last year. They wanted to help fix up Jewish cemeteries. Some of the graves had been purposefully destroyed.

Muqtedar Khan is a professor. He believes that now is the time to unite the two faiths. He believes young people will help.  

"They have common ground in seeking social justice in America," Khan said.
