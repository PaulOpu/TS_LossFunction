A new video service is coming to Instagram to challenge YouTube

SAN FRANCISCO, California — Facebook and Instagram are social media websites. Both sites are trying to keep young people interested in them. 

Facebook runs Instagram. It is a place people post pictures and short videos. It is changing the rules for Instagram videos. The changes are trying to pull young people away from YouTube. Many people go to YouTube to watch videos. Instagram wants to give people more video choices to watch on their phones.

Instagram has allowed people to post short videos. Now it will let them post longer ones. It is more like what YouTube does. 

Website Copycats

Some websites copy each other. Instagram copies ideas to try to be a cool place for young people to share and visit. Now, Instagram is copying YouTube. Facebook and Instagram already copied Snapchat, another website.

Instagram is nearly 8 years old. It is growing from its start as a place to share photos. 

Facebook has had trouble getting teens to be interested. It does not want Instagram to lose teens, too.  

Facebook, YouTube, Instagram Race For Users

Kevin Systrom is the leader of Instagram. He said that he hopes longer videos will help performers. They can become famous, with young people as fans, he said.

That already happens on YouTube. It has become the world's most popular place for videos. Many, many people go to YouTube.

Facebook bought Instagram six years ago. Instagram also has many people using it.

Social media websites want teens to use them. YouTube has the most U.S. teens users from 13 to 17 years old, a study center said. Instagram is next.  Only about half of people that age use Facebook. 

Selling Ads To Make More Money

Paul Verna works for the company eMarketer. He thinks Facebook wants to get more teens into Instagram.  

The videos could help make more money. That is because Instagram can sell ads to go with them. 

Right now, Instagram does not have video ads. Systrom said it will later. When the ads come, Instagram plans to share the money. Some will go to the people who made the videos. YouTube already shares ad money.

Videos Will Fill The Whole Screen

Lele Pons is a YouTube star. She also has many followers on Instagram. She plans to put a cooking show on Instagram. "It's like Coca-Cola and Pepsi," she said. "You will never know what you like better unless you try both."

Instagram will use vertical video. It will fill the whole screen on phones. Many younger people watch videos on their phones. Most YouTube videos fill only part of the screen unless the phone is turned sideways. That could be changing.
