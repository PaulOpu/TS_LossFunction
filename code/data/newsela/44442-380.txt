Artist wants floating artwork in London to make you think

Christo is an artist. He is famous around the world. On Monday, he opened his new art sculpture. It is made from 7,506 barrels. They are floating on a lake in London. London is the capital of England. The artwork is a mystery. People do not know what it means. If Christo knows, he is not telling. He wants people to start talking about it.

The name of the piece is "The London Mastaba."

Really Big And Heavy

The artwork is in the shape of a mastaba. A mastaba is a type of ancient Egyptian tomb. The London Mastaba looks like a pyramid with a flat top. It is really big. It is about 65 feet high, 98 feet wide and 130 feet long. It is very heavy. It weighs about 1.3 million pounds! The barrels are made out of metal. They can be seen from far away.

The barrels are very colorful. There are red barrels with white candy stripes. Others are blue, purple and red.

A Message About Pollution?

People are wondering what it means. Many think the barrels look like barrels of oil. Maybe Christo was sending a message about pollution.

Christo is 83 years old. He was born in Bulgaria, a country in Europe. He is now a U.S. citizen. He says he was not sending a message. People must think about it and decide for themselves.

Christo is famous for his large artworks. He is known for wrapping large structures in cloth.

The piece will stay in the lake until September 23. Then the barrels will be taken down. They will be recycled.

People Surprised To See Huge Artwork

The artwork has gotten a lot of attention. Many people were surprised to see it.

Yasmin Koz Ozcengel is from Turkey. She said the piece is very modern. She does not think a park is a good place for it. The park is full of nature and history.

Sheila Steffenson is an American living in London. She is not sure how she feels. Steffenson wonders what it means, although it might not mean anything. Maybe it is about pollution, she said. "Who knows?"
