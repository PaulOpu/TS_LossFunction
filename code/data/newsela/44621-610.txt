Supreme Court rules in favor of Trump's travel ban

The Supreme Court made a big decision on Tuesday, June 26. The court said President Donald Trump's travel ban is allowed. The ban limits travel from several Muslim-majority countries. Those fighting against the rule said that it was unfair to Muslims. They said the president went outside of his powers to make the rule. The court disagreed.

The Supreme Court is the highest court of the United States. It has nine members, known as justices. Five justices agreed with the decision. Four justices did not. A justice who disagreed said the court was making a big mistake.

Victory For Trump

The June 26 decision is a big victory for Trump. The president responded quickly on social media. He tweeted, "Wow!"

When the Supreme Court makes a decision, it explains why. The justices write what is called a majority opinion. The justices who do not agree write their own response. It is called a minority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion for the five justices.

Roberts said presidents have certain powers. The president can choose who can come into the country. He also said the rule is not unfair to Muslims.

Rule Is Not Good Or Bad

He was careful not to agree with some of what Trump says, though. Trump promised to keep Muslims from entering the country, for example. He said this in 2015 while running for president. Roberts did not say he agreed with Trump on this.

Roberts wrote that the court only says that the rule is allowed. The court does not say if the rule is good. It also does not say if the rule is bad.

Anti-Muslim Feelings

Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not agree with the majority. She explained why in an opinion. She said that Trump's ban was based on anti-Muslim feelings. She said the justices in the majority came to the wrong result. They did not get the facts right, she said.

The Trump rule applies to travelers from certain countries. They include Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. They are Muslim-majority countries. The president says the limits will make the United States safer. He says they may stop bad people from coming to the U.S.

Judges in Hawaii and Maryland had already looked at the travel ban. They blocked the ban from taking effect.

The Supreme Court came to a different decision on June 26, though. Roberts said the rule is made to address real safety problems. The ban is allowed, he said.
