The United Nations is a group made up of countries all across the world.  UNESCO is part of the United Nations. UNESCO brings attention to different cultures around the world.

UNESCO teamed up with the technology company Microsoft. Together, they made the UNESCO & Microsoft Hackathon for Culture and Peace. It is a contest for high schoolers. 

The contest asked teams to make a web or mobile app. The apps had to involve the history of countries in the region of Southeast Asia.

Exploring Southeast Asia

A team called NASHIMETEKO won the contest. Their app is called "Sea Wander." In it, players can explore famous Southeast Asia landmarks. 

The images in "Sea Wander" are bright. They look like cartoons. Upbeat music plays in the background.

NASHIMETEKO were announced as winners May 21.

Eighteen-year-old Yensira Chaisuk is on team NASHIMETEKO. "I learned so many new things" by making the app, she said. She said she learned all about Southeast Asia's history.

The NASHIMETEKO team won about $600 of prize money. They also got a trophy from Thailand's Royal Highness Princess.

A Future In Science, Engineering And The Arts

The five teammates live in Thailand. They are about to enter college. Each will continue studying science, engineering and the arts. 

Microsoft hopes more young women will explore jobs in STEM. It stands for science, technology, engineering and math. The Hackathon was part of that effort. 

Each team had to have a mix of boys and girls, or all girls. 

"Sea Wander" teaches the history of rice and silk-making. Players can choose to be a rice farmer in the island of Bali. They can also be a silk maker in the country of Cambodia. Players may plow fields or feed silk worms during mini-games.

There were five final teams. They had been working on their apps since March.

The Shared Histories Project

The app fit with a UNESCO project that began in 2015. It is called Shared Histories. 

There are 11 countries in Southeast Asia. Schools there often teach history in a similar way. They tend to show nearby countries as enemies, not neighbors.

These ideas influence many people's thinking. The Shared Histories project hopes to change these ideas. It wants to show how the nations are similar. UNESCO hopes the project will help the countries build respect for each other. 

"Sea Wander" matched with the goal of Shared Histories.

Desarack Teso is an official at Microsoft. He was one of the contest judges. Teso praised "Sea Wander." He said it blended technology and learning very well.
