Original "Jurassic Park" film sparked a renewed interest in dinosaurs

As a boy, Jordan Mallon thought about what he might do when he grew up. He might be a hockey player or an artist. He also was interested in dinosaurs.  

In 1993, Jordan's father took him to see the movie, "Jurassic Park." He was 11 years old. That night, he told his mother, "I want to be a paleontologist."

A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils, the remains of ancient life. Fossils have been preserved by natural processes. Skeletons are an example.

Mallon is now a dinosaur paleontologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Canada. He says the movie was a turning point. As soon as he saw it, he knew what he wanted to do. 

After "Jurassic Park" opened, many people went to see it. The film sparked interest in dinosaurs and paleontology. 

People still like "Jurassic Park" stories. The fifth one, "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom," opened on Friday, June 22. 

New View Of Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs were once seen as slow, stupid monsters. People thought they were boring. 

New studies came in the 1960s, though. They showed dinosaurs as smart animals. Then Michael Crichton wrote the book, "Jurassic Park," in 1990. Steven Spielberg made it into a movie. The movie used computers to bring dinosaurs to life. 

Thomas Cullen is a scientist at The Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. He says the dinosaurs in the movie seemed real. "They really seemed like they were alive," he says. 

Beyond Child's Play

The movie got people excited to learn about dinosaurs. 

Before the film, there were not many dinosaur books and toys. 

More books came out after the movie. Studies about dinosaurs got more attention. Paleontologists wrote more papers. Universities began teaching classes on dinosaurs. 

People saw that their love of dinosaurs could turn into a job.

Andrew Farke liked dinosaurs as a child. People called him "the dinosaur kid." "Jurassic Park" came out when he was 12 years old. 

Farke saw that he could be more than just a dinosaur fan. He started thinking about being a paleontologist, he says. Now he works in paleontology at a museum in California.

A Golden Age For Dinosaur Discovery

"Jurassic Park" made dinosaurs seem cool. It also made the scientists who study them seem cool. People wanted to be like them. 

The many scientists starting out after "Jurassic Park" changed paleontology. They helped to discover new things. 

New kinds of dinosaurs are being discovered each year.  

Discovering Science

Dinosaurs can get people interested in science. 

That is what happened for Thomas Adams. He was 25 years old when "Jurassic Park" came out. He left his job at a music store.

Adams says he became a paleontologist because of "Jurassic Park." People don't believe it, he says. He is now a paleontologist at a museum in Texas.

Studying dinosaurs helped him see that learning could be fun. 

"I rediscovered learning," he said.
