walk-forest-level|"[""Going through the forest is my favourite part of the walk. My dog Benji loves it too. I’m Grace. I live on a farm with my parents and I take Benji for a walk most days after school. While Benji’s playing, I stop to take a photo of a butterfly. I’m thinking about posting it on Facebook, but then I hear Benji barking. He’s jumping and running around a boy. The poor boy looks worried. 'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and throw him his ball. I’m about to say sorry to the boy, but he’s gone."", 'It’s cold today, so Benji and I are walking fast. As we go through the forest, it starts raining so I run. Suddenly, I fall and I’m on my back. OUCH! That hurt! ', ""Then there’s someone there and a voice asks 'Are you all right?' I look up and see the boy from yesterday. 'I’m OK,' I say and the boy helps me up. 'I haven’t seen you at school. Do you live near here?' I ask. 'No, I’m from Manchester,' he says. 'Sorry! I have to go. Can you walk? Do you need help?' 'No, I’m fine. Thanks!' I say and the boy walks away. 'I’m Grace,' I call. 'What’s your name?' but he’s already gone. At home, Mum’s watching the news. 'Hi Grace. Do you know  about this boy, Mark?' she asks. 'No, what boy?' I say. 'A boy from Manchester. He’s run away from home. Look! This is his dad.' There’s a man on TV sitting with a policeman. He’s crying as the policeman asks people to help. Then they show a photo of the missing boy. It’s the boy from the forest. He’s Mark. Should I say something? 'Poor man,' says Mum. 'I just hope they find his son soon.' No, I mustn’t say anything. If I tell Mum, the police will come and find Mark. What if he’s run away for a good reason? I should talk to him first."", ""I can’t find Mark, so I shout, 'Mark, where are you?' No answer. 'Mark,' I shout again, 'I know about you.' After a moment, he appears. 'What do you know? How do you know my name?' 'Your dad was on TV. The police are looking for you.' He looks shocked. 'Did you say anything? Have you told them?' 'No,' I say. 'I wanted to talk to you first. What’s happened? Why have you run away?' 'I had an argument with my dad. A bad one.' 'What about?' I ask. Mark points to a fallen tree and we sit down. 'My mum died four years ago. It was a very difficult time for me and for Dad. He was sad for a long time, but then he met someone new. Mel’s her name.' 'Oh, and don’t you like her?' I ask. 'No, not much. She’s not a bad person, but we don’t really connect. She wants my dad for herself and she isn’t interested in me.' 'But, what about your dad? Have you talked to him?' 'He tells me to try harder with her, but I can’t. The night I ran away, he told me that we’re all moving to London. Mel’s from London, you see. Then he told me that he and Mel want to get married and have a baby. We both got angry and I told him I’m not moving to London. I took my tent and I left in the middle of the night.' 'But what will you do? You can’t live here.' I tell him. 'I know, but my grandad and my friends are in Manchester. I don’t want to move to London.' 'You might like London,' I say. 'That’s what my dad says.' I feel sorry for Mark, but I think of his dad crying on TV and feel sorry for him too. 'What are you going to do?' I ask. 'I don’t know. I need time to think.'"", ""Mark’s waiting for me in the forest. I’ve got some news. 'The police came to the farm this morning. They’re going to search the forest tomorrow.' Mark looks sad, 'I didn’t want this. My dad, crying on TV and the police looking for me. I don’t know what to do.' 'I’ve got an idea. Why don’t you live with your grandad in Manchester? Let your dad and Mel move to London and visit them in the holidays.' Mark doesn’t answer at first, then he looks at me and smiles. 'Can I use your phone?' he asks. 'I need to call my dad.'"", 'Robin Newton']"|"['Going through the forest is my favourite part of the walk. Benji loves it too. There are rabbits to run after and old leaves to smell.

The boy’s about my age and looks worried. 'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and reach into my pocket for his ball. I’m about to apologise to the boy, but he’s gone, disappeared between the trees."", ""I’m out with Benji again. It’s cold and rainy today, so we’re going fast. As I’m coming through the forest, it starts raining hard, so I run. Suddenly, I’m slipping and falling and, before I know it, I’m lying on my back. Ouch! That hurt.

Benji barks to say hello, he’s scared of cats and wouldn’t hurt anyone, but, of course, other people don’t know that. Benji’s barking and jumping round a boy. The boy’s about my age.

It’s cold and rainy today and I’ve got a mountain of homework to do, so we’re going at a brisk pace. No admiring butterflies or photos today. As I’m coming through the forest, I feel the first drops of rain so I start to run. Suddenly, I’m slipping and falling and, before I know it, I’m flat on my back. Ouch! That hurt. Then there’s someone there and a voice says,  'Are you all right? That was a bad fall.' I look up and see the boy from yesterday. 'I’m OK, I think,' I say uncertainly.

Why have you run away?' He looks at the ground, then up at me. 'I had an argument with my dad. A bad one.' 'What about?' I ask. It’s not my business, but the question just comes out. Mark gestures to a fallen tree and we sit down. He’s quiet for a while, then he takes a deep breath. 'My mum died four years ago. It was very tough. Tough for me and for Dad.

Every year, thousands of people try to climb the world’s highest mountains or walk across continents. Let’s take a look at some of the 21st century’s greatest adventurers.', 'Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person to walk along the Amazon River from the mountains of Peru to the mouth of the river in Brazil. His amazing journey took two years and four months. There are many dangerous animals in the rainforest, like snakes and crocodiles, but Ed was lucky; he was only bitten by ants and mosquitoes. On his trip, Ed had to find fruit and nuts or catch fish each morning. Sometimes food was hard to find and Ed was often tired and hungry.', 'Technology was very important for Ed. He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and help. Many people came to meet him and guide him through the rainforest. While he walked, Ed wrote a blog to tell the world about climate change and destruction of the rainforest.', 'Did you know that more than 4,000 people have climbed Everest? Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria is one of them. She is one of the world’s greatest climbers and has climbed all the world’s mountains over 8,000 metres. It’s very difficult to climb in cold weather and storms, but Gerlinde loves it. She started climbing as a teenager in the mountains near her home. When she left school she became a nurse but always went climbing in her free time. Now she spends her time climbing and helping a charity for poor children in Nepal.', 'Some adventurers are always looking for a new challenge. Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed mountains, ridden a bike across Canada and run races in the desert. But her most incredible journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole. As she skied, Meagan pulled a sledge with a tent and all her food. She skied through terrible storms and freezing temperatures for forty days till she arrived at the South Pole. Erik Weihenmayer from the United States has climbed mountains and ridden a bike through deserts. Amazingly, Erik is blind and he wants other blind people to have active lives too. He has taken groups of young blind people climbing in Nepal.', 'Technology is a big help for adventurers but the world is still a dangerous place and it’s very important to prepare well.

If so, you’re not alone. Every year, thousands of people try to climb the world’s highest mountains or walk across continents. In the past, explorers had compasses and maps, but today’s adventurers have satellite phones and GPS. They also use their travels to let the world know about climate change and help people in the countries they visit. Let’s take a look at some of the 21st century’s greatest adventurers.', 'Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person to walk the length of the Amazon River. He started by a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river’s mouth in Brazil, two years and four months later. Snakes, crocodiles and jaguars live in the Amazon rainforest, so it’s a dangerous place. Luckily, Ed avoided the big animals, but he was bitten by ants and mosquitoes every day. On his trip, Ed had to find food each morning. Sometimes the fruit, nuts and fish he ate were hard to find and Ed often felt weak and hungry.', 'Technology was essential for Ed. He used a radio to ask local people for food and permission to enter their land. Many of them came to meet him and guide him through the dense rainforest. As he walked, Ed wrote a blog about his daily experiences.', 'Ed used his walk to let the world know about climate change and raise money for environmental charities in Brazil and Peru.', 'Four thousand climbers, aged between 13 and 80, have been to the top of Everest. Climbing high mountains requires a lot of preparation and is very dangerous, but some of the world’s best climbers are now looking for new challenges.', 'Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria fell in love with climbing as a teenager. When she left school, she worked as a nurse and climbed in her free time. Starting with Everest, she has been climbing all the world’s fourteen peaks over 8,000 metres. To increase the challenge, Gerlinde climbs without using oxygen tanks. Low oxygen levels can make climbers ill, so Gerlinde has to climb slowly. Gerlinde is passionate about Nepal and raises money for a charity for poor children and orphans there.', 'Some of today’s adventurers go from challenge to challenge. Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed the highest mountain on each continent, ridden a bike across Canada and run a long-distance race in the Sahara Desert. But perhaps her most incredible journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole. She pulled a tent and all her food on a sledge behind her as she skied. On the first day, she fell into a glacier and had to be rescued. Many people would have given up, but Meagan decided to carry on. Skiing through ice storms, she arrived at the South Pole forty days later.', 'Erik Weihenmayer from the United States is another unstoppable adventurer. He’s climbed mountains, ridden a bike through the deserts of Morocco and kayaked through the Grand Canyon. Amazingly, Erik has been blind since the age of 13. Apart from his travels, he helps people with disabilities to live active lives and takes groups of young blind people on climbing expeditions.', 'Despite new technologies, adventurers still have to live with terrible weather, lack of food and wild animals. Preparation and training are essential, but if you have a sense of adventure, there are continents to cross and hundreds of mountains to climb.']|['Have you ever dreamt of climbing Mount Everest or walking to the South Pole?

animals-city-level|['One night in December 2011, a bear came into the city of Vancouver in Canada. It walked through the city streets past houses, shops and offices. Then it found some food in bins outside a restaurant and started eating. In the morning, someone saw the bear and called the police. The police came with a vet from the city zoo. They put the bear in a lorry and took it to the mountains outside the city. Luckily, the bear was safe. But what happens in other countries when big animals come into cities? In Vancouver it is unusual to see a bear, but in some cities you can see big animals on the city streets every day. Big animals usually come into cities to find food. In Cape Town in South Africa baboons come into the city when they are hungry. They go into gardens and eat fruit from trees. They even go into houses and take food from cupboards and fridges! Baboons are strong animals and they can scare people. But the city can be dangerous for baboons too. Sometimes, cars and buses kill baboons in accidents. Human food is very bad for the baboons’ teeth because it has a lot of sugar. Now, there are Baboon Monitors working in Cape Town. Their job is to find baboons in the city and return them to the countryside. In Berlin in Germany, pigs sometimes come into the city to look for food. They eat flowers and plants in parks and gardens. Sometimes they eat vegetables from gardens and they walk in the street and cause accidents. Some people like the pigs and they give them food and water to drink. Other people do not like the pigs and they want the government and the police to stop them entering the city. In Moscow in Russia, there are 35,000 wild dogs. The dogs live in parks, old houses, markets and train stations. Some dogs live in groups and others live alone. Many people in Moscow like the dogs. They give them food and water. Some people make small houses for the dogs in their gardens. This helps the dogs in winter, when the temperature in Moscow is -10 ºC and there is a lot of snow and ice. Many animals live in cities. In some cities, you can see birds, insects, mice and squirrels every day. But sometimes, it is dangerous when big animals come into cities to find food. We need to find ways of stopping animals coming into the city without hurting them.', 'Robin Newton']|"[""Recently, there have been many reports in newspapers and on TV about big animals coming into towns and cities. There have been bears in Vancouver parks, leopards on the streets of Mumbai and wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when big animals come into our cities? Is it a good thing or is it dangerous for us and the animals? Wild animals usually come into cities to look for food. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons sometimes come into the suburbs. They eat fruit from gardens and go into people's kitchens and take food from cupboards and fridges! Baboons are strong animals and sometimes they scare children and fight with pet dogs. Many people do not like them, but the city can be dangerous for baboons too. Sometimes, baboons are hurt in car accidents and the sugar in human food can be very bad for their teeth. The city council in Cape Town has a team of Baboon Monitors. Their job is to find baboons in the city and take them back to the countryside. This makes the city safer for people and it is healthier for the baboons. The problem is that a lot of baboons will come back to the city to find food again. In Berlin in Germany, groups of wild pigs sometimes come into the city to look for food. Pigs have come into the city for hundreds of years, but now the winters are warmer, there are more pigs than in the past. Pigs eat flowers and plants and dig in gardens and parks in the city. They also walk in the street and cause traffic accidents. Some city residents like the pigs and give them food. But the city council is worried about the traffic accidents. They have told people to stop giving the pigs food and have put up fences to stop the pigs entering the city.  In Moscow in Russia, there are 35,000 wild dogs. They live in parks, empty houses, markets and train stations. Some of the dogs were pets that people did not want so they left them on the streets. Others were born on the streets and have always lived there. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs (a pack is the name for a group of dogs). In 2010, scientists studied the dogs. They found some very interesting facts:"", 'What do the people in Moscow think of the dogs? A lot of people like them and are used to seeing them on the streets. They give the dogs food and water to drink. The winter in Moscow is very cold with lots of snow and temperatures of -10 ºC. It can be hard for dogs to survive but some city residents have built small huts for the dogs to live in during the winter. Mice, squirrels and birds often live in cities and survive. Some bigger animals like the dogs in Moscow can survive in the city too, with a little help from their human friends. For many big animals, cities are dangerous places and they need our help to return to the countryside.', 'Robin Newton']"|"[""Small animals like birds, squirrels, mice and insects are a common sight in many cities and towns. But in recent years, the world's press has been full of reports of wild animals coming into cities in bigger and bigger numbers. There have been bears in Vancouver parks, leopards on the streets of Mumbai and wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Are they welcome or are they considered a danger or a pest? Often wild animals come into cities to look for food. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons have started coming into residential areas on the edge of the city to feed. They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and orchards. Some brave baboons have even come into people's houses and taken food from kitchen cupboards and fridges! Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence. The city can be a dangerous place for baboons too. Some have been injured or killed in car accidents and others have been electrocuted as they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species and to save them and minimise conflicts between humans and baboons, the city council has employed a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food. In Berlin in Germany, groups of wild pigs often come into the suburbs to look for food. They dig up parks and gardens looking for roots, fungi, insects and other small animals to eat. Apart from damage to parks and gardens, the pigs have also caused several traffic accidents as they are slow to move off roads when cars are approaching. In spite of this, some city residents welcome the pigs and have been giving them food. They argue that pigs have been coming into the city for centuries and that people should learn to live with them. This attitude was not shared by the city council. Their first reaction was to employ a group of hunters to shoot young pigs. Many city residents complained that this was unnecessarily cruel and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers. In response to protests, the city council decided to take more peaceful action against pigs. Instead of shooting them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past. One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, there are approximately 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some of the dogs were born wild, while others are pets that have been abandoned by their owners. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and found that the dogs have adapted remarkably successfully to urban life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs appear to understand traffic lights. Dogs that live in packs have learnt that humans are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs so those dogs are sent to beg for food for the whole pack. Some dogs have even learnt to use the city's metro system to get from one part of their territory to another! Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their excellent sense of smell and have learnt to recognise the scents of their favourite destinations. Another possibility is that they have learnt to recognise the names of stations they hear in announcements. Either way, metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals. Many city residents have grown fond of the dogs. Some people feed them and others have built shelters to help the dogs survive the brutally cold Moscow winters. Some animals, like the dogs in Moscow, have adapted very well to city life. For others, the city is a dangerous place and it is difficult for animals to live in harmony with humans. It would be a shame to hurt or kill animals when they come into cities to look for food. Hopefully, city councils, conservationists and city residents can work together and find imaginative ways to keep bigger animals out of cities without harming them."", 'Robin Newton']"|('punct',

good-night-stories-rebel-girls-book-review-level|['We all know how fairy tales go. A beautiful girl waits for a prince to find her. Then she gets married to him and becomes a princess. But what if the girl was clever or strong instead of beautiful? What if she wanted to be an astronaut, a politician or a pirate instead of a princess? And what if she didn’t need a prince to do it? That’s the idea behind the book Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls. It’s a book of fairy tales with a difference: all the stories are true. The book tells the stories of one hundred amazing women from 1500 BC to today. But, the stories aren’t just boring biographies. Instead, they’re like fairy tales. You probably won’t know the names of most of the women but, when you finish reading, you’ll ask yourself why. Sometimes, it’s because people tried to remove them from history. Like Hatshepsut, one of the most important queens of Egypt. After she died, some men broke her statues and removed her name from documents. Other times, it’s because a man’s name became more famous. For example, Charles Babbage is called the ‘father of computers’ but a woman, Ada Lovelace, wrote the first computer program. Why haven’t we learned about these women before? Often history remembers men more than women. If you close your eyes and think of a war hero and a pilot, you probably think of men. If you read the book, those pictures might start to become women of all colours and ages. The women in the book did things because they wanted to and they didn’t listen when people told them not to. One problem with the book, unfortunately, is its name, because it gives the idea it’s a book for girls. It’s a great idea to show young girls what women can do. But the stories are also interesting for boys to read. And it’s also important that boys can think of women in jobs like doctor, Formula One race car driver and president. Not all the women included are ‘good girls’. One woman, Jingū, Empress of Japan, decided to start a war with Korea because of a dream. Is it a problem that the book doesn’t say that was a bad thing? Another example is pirates. The two women pirates in the book are unusual heroes because pirates were dangerous and they killed other people. It’s good to see a variety of women but why not show a bad ending to their story sometimes? We can understand that just because they’re female, they’re not always good people. You could read one story every night but you probably won’t want to stop with one. If you finish quickly, don’t worry because there are now two Rebel Girls books. The writers, Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, found the money to make both books from crowdfunding on Kickstarter. In 2016 they got one million dollars from 13,454 people from 75 countries. For the second book, in 2017, they did it again. This time they found another $866,000. The first book sold a million copies in 36 different languages and the second book will probably do the same.

Margaret Thatcher’s story is a good example. She was Britain’s first female prime minister and it gives one example of why people liked her and one example of why people didn’t like her.

graffiti-street-art-level|"[""Modern graffiti began in big cities in the United States in the 1970s. In New York, young people wrote their names, or 'tags', in pen on walls around the city. One of the first 'taggers' was a teenager called Demetrius. His tag was TAKI 183. He wrote his tag on walls and in stations in New York. Other teenagers saw Demetrius's tag and started writing their tags too. Soon, there were tags on walls, buses and trains all over New York. Then, some teenagers started writing their tags with aerosol paint. Their tags were bigger and more colourful. Aerosol paint graffiti became very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. It appeared on trains, buses and walls around the world. In the 1990s and 2000s, a lot of graffiti artists started painting pictures. Some artists' pictures were about politics.

In the 1990s, graffiti continued but there was also an explosion in street art around the world. Some artists wanted to make political points and produced art that tried to make people think about war, inequality and discrimination. Other street artists were more concerned with producing beautiful, attractive work. In South America, many street artists went to work in poor areas adding colour, life and beauty to grey, city walls."", ""Is graffiti art or vandalism? This depends on your point of view, but in many countries, writing or painting on public or private property is considered vandalism. Many street artists have been stopped by the police and some have had to pay fines. Many city councils complain about the high cost of cleaning graffiti off buildings, buses and trains. In some areas, councils have tried to encourage artists not to paint randomly on walls by allowing them to work in designated areas. Taiwan is one such place and there are 'graffiti zones' where artists are free to paint and write on walls. In São Paulo in Brazil, the city council has even allowed some graffiti artists to paint on the city's subway trains. And what does the art world think of graffiti and street art? Recently, there has been a growing recognition of its value as an art form. There have been major exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles. The American artist Elura Emerald organised a street art exhibition at a New York gallery in 2008. She defended street artists, saying 'artists who paint on the street are merely expressing themselves, not hurting anyone. They should be appreciated and celebrated'."", 'Most street artists are anonymous, but others have become globally famous. Here are three stars of the street art world:', ""It is impossible to know how street art will develop in the future but certain trends are emerging. While most street artists are young people who paint in their city or neighbourhood, more and more street artists are travelling and working around the globe. Other artists are using the internet to talk to each other and share photos of their work. Also, the art world is giving more recognition to street art as a legitimate art form.

hidden-treasure-rocky-mountains-level|['Every year, thousands of people look in the Rocky Mountains in the US for $2 million of treasure. The treasure belongs to Forrest Fenn. He has collected art for his whole life. In 2010, when he was 80, he went into the Rocky Mountains by car and then on foot. He put the treasure somewhere in the woods. So that’s one clue about where it is: an old man can walk there with a heavy box.', 'But the nine most important clues are in a poem (available to read on his website). They are much more difficult to understand. Treasure hunters look at every word in the poem and they look for extra clues in Forrest’s two books about his life.', 'Here is one part to start with:', 'Begin it where warm waters stop And take it in the canyon down, Not far, but too far to walk. Put in below the home of Brown.', '‘Warm waters’ and ‘the home of Brown’ are probably important clues. Warm and cold water could be two rivers. Brown might be a person because names usually start with a capital letter. So, maybe you have to look for people called Brown who live in the Rocky Mountains. Unfortunately, a lot of people have the surname Brown!', 'The only way to test your ideas is to try and find the treasure. Forrest says people should wait until spring because winter weather is dangerous. He also says people shouldn’t go alone. But not everyone listens. Three people have gone missing while they were looking for the treasure. The police want Forrest to take the treasure and put a photo of himself with the box on the internet.

Read this interview with them and find out more about their favourite sport.', 'Monica: Skateboarding began in California in the 1950s, but we don’t know who the first person to go on a skateboard was.', 'Carl: In the beginning, skateboarding was popular with surfers. They wanted to practise surfing on land when the ocean was calm or the weather was bad.', 'Monica: There are skate parks in lots of towns and cities. They are special places for skateboarding. You can practise jumps at skate parks and meet other skateboarders.', 'Carl: You can skateboard in the street too, but you have to look out for the traffic, people, bicycles and dogs.', 'Monica: When I was a child, I liked going rollerskating with my friends. When I was thirteen, one of my friends got a skateboard and I tried it. I fell several times but I loved it. Two weeks later, I got my first skateboard. I haven’t stopped rollerskating. I like both sports now.', 'Carl: I live in the city and there’s a skate park near my house. When I was eleven, my dad gave me a skateboard for my birthday and I spent the summer skateboarding at the skate park. I love the freedom and speed. When I was a child, I rode my bike every day, but I never ride it now.', 'Carl: All skateboarders fall off their boards but fortunately most injuries are minor. It’s a good idea to wear a helmet to protect your head.', 'Monica: Yes, there are. They usually take place in skate parks. Skateboarders do jumps or tricks. The skateboarders who do the most difficult jumps or tricks win.', 'Carl: There was a campaign to get skateboarding included in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro but unfortunately it wasn’t successful. But who knows? Maybe, skateboarding will be in the 2020 games!', 'Monica: “Go Skateboarding Day” is on the 21st of June every year. In the United States, Europe and Australia, there are competitions, parties and barbecues for skateboarders.', 'Carl: At the moment, the fashion is for skateboarders to wear tight jeans or black trousers and a T-shirt or check shirt. Baseball caps and hats are popular too.', 'Monica: A lot of skateboarders have long hair too. But fashion doesn’t matter. For me, enjoying the sport is more important than clothes.', 'Monica: A long board is skateboard that’s longer and has got bigger wheels. Skateboards are usually 70 to 80 centimetres long, but long boards are 90 to 120 centimetres long. It’s difficult to do jumps on a long board, but you can go fast.', 'Carl: Listen to this! In 2006, a skateboarder went across Australia on a long board. That’s 5,850 kilometres!', 'Robin Newton']|['Monica and Carl are teenagers from Los Angeles in the United States.

There were lots of surfers who wanted something to do when it wasn’t windy and the ocean was calm, so they invented the skateboard and it was called “land surfing” in the beginning.', 'Carl: The first skateboards were pieces of wood with wheels from rollerskates that people made at home. When skateboarding became popular, they started making skateboards in factories.', 'Carl: You can go skateboarding in public places like parks, pavements and city squares. Some skateboarders like “freestyle” skateboarding, which is going fast along pavements or bicycle lanes. Other skateboarders like doing jumps and tricks on benches, stairs or railings. It’s great fun, but you have to watch out for pedestrians.', 'Monica: There are also lots of skate parks in towns and cities. The good thing about skate parks is that you can practise jumps without disturbing anyone. You can meet other skaters at a skate park too.', 'Monica: When I was a child, I used to go rollerskating with friends. When I was thirteen, I tried one of my friend’s skateboards.

I used to ride my bike a lot, but I never go on it now.', 'Carl: We all fall off our boards and get hurt sometimes, but most injuries are minor cuts and bruises. Obviously, it’s a good idea to wear a helmet and protect your head. It’s important to protect your hands and wrists too. Hands and wrists are the part of the body that you’re most likely to injure as you put out your hands to protect yourself when you fall.

In the past, Jessii felt bad when people said negative things about her. ‘Some people online are so quick to write hate comments,’ she says. Some people said that she has really big cheeks and a really thin mouth. It made her feel bad until she found a different way to think. ‘People were negative about things that I can’t change.

People know when you only care about being popular. ‘When you actually focus on something you love, you’ll grow so much faster, trust me!’', 'Nicola Prentis']"|"['Do weird, funny or interesting things happen to you a lot? Are you good at telling stories? Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of people wanting to hear about your life?', 'That’s what life is like for YouTube star, Jessii Vee. Her videos of funny stories about herself, and ‘Creepy Neighbourhood’, have been watched over 150 million times and subscribers to her channel grow every day. In just a month after I first found Jessii’s YouTube channel, she had gained over 8,000 new subscribers. And a video that’s only been on her channel for five days had already been watched 169,000 times. ', 'With these kinds of numbers, you might think Jessii is an international star with her face on magazine covers all around the world. But she’s just a regular 23-year-old living in Ontario, Canada, with a talent for turning her life into her work, six days a week. ‘My days change depending on if it’s the beginning of the week or the end,’ says Jessii. ‘Typically I’ll spend the whole day Sunday thinking of ideas and researching for videos that I want to film that week. Then, come Monday, I’ll wake up bright and early to start filming. Usually a video will take just over an hour to film, and I try to film around five, so it takes up most of my day. Then, from Tuesday to Friday I’m usually editing them.’', 'Being a YouTuber isn’t just about making videos. Jessii also spends a few hours a week replying to messages from her subscribers. Sometimes she meets fans in person because, since passing 700,000 subscribers, she gets recognised when she goes out. ‘It’s so funny because I can meet subscribers anywhere and everywhere,’ she says. ‘The other day I went to buy coffee and there was a girl serving me who almost dropped my coffee when she realised it was me. She actually left the coffee shop to meet me in the parking lot to take pictures. It always makes me happy to see them greet me with a huge smile.’', 'Online life isn’t all wonderful and Jessii used to feel bad when people said negative things about her. ‘Some people online are so quick to write hate comments,’ she explains. There were people who said that she has huge cheeks and really thin lips. It made her feel bad until she found strength inside herself. ‘I realised that the things people were hating on were things about myself that I couldn’t change. So I decided to love those things and became more confident in myself. Now, she just laughs when she sees a hate comment. ‘I know that they are from people who don’t feel good about themselves and I know that I have way more supporters than haters.’', ""So for anyone who wants to start a YouTube channel, Jessii has some advice. ‘Be yourself. If you hate wearing make-up, don’t wear any when you film! Don't change to impress people. They will fall in love with YOU! When I first started YouTube, I was extremely self-conscious. Mostly because I wanted to look good and act in a way that people would like. If you look back at my old videos, I seem uncomfortable because I’m not being myself. But when you look at the videos I make now, you can see that I’m completely myself. I’m crazy and weird, and I don’t care what people think.’"", ""Not all the big YouTube stars tell stories about their lives. The biggest YouTubers are often gamers, but there are others that make comedy or make-up videos. Jessii thinks you should ‘base your channel around something you are passionate about, not something that is trending. Your goal should be to make videos that inspire people. People can tell when you’re forcing content because you just want to be popular. When you actually focus on something you love, you'll grow so much faster, trust me!’"", 'There are some other things to think about before starting a YouTube channel. It’s a good idea to think about privacy and safety. You don’t need to show your face or real name and you shouldn’t tell people where you live, for example. One of the most famous YouTubers, DanTDM, a 26-year-old English man, began his YouTube career playing ‘Minecraft’ and telling stories about the characters in the game, but he didn’t show his face at first. Another thing you might want to do is turn off the comments so you don’t find any ‘haters’ like Jessii did.', 'By starting their careers with a YouTube channel, some of the most famous YouTube stars have written books, been on TV and toured the world doing live shows. DanTDM went on a tour of America, Australia and the UK in 2017. Tickets sold out in minutes, with no advertising except Dan talking about the tour on YouTube. It’s not surprising if you think that Dan’s YouTube videos have been watched almost 11 billion times. Films and TV can’t even begin to compare with numbers as high as this. The biggest worldwide TV show, the music competition Idols, has been watched by about 6.5 billion people and about 5 billion people saw a part of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.', 'Nicola

She’s also very passionate about what we read. In this age of video games and texting, she thinks it’s even more important for young people to keep reading books. “Reading exposes you to so many different people, places and times,” she says. “But more importantly, it’s an intimate and personal experience.

life-pi-book-review-level|"['The Life of Pi is about a teenage boy from India, called Pi, who travels across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat. His companion in the lifeboat is an enormous tiger. It was written by the Canadian author Yann Martel, and has sold seven million copies worldwide.', 'At the start of the book, we learn about Pi’s childhood in India. His father is a zookeeper and the family live in a house in the zoo. Pi and his brother help their father in the zoo and learn to look after the animals.', 'When Pi is 16, his family decide to close the zoo and move to Canada. They sell some of the animals to zoos in North America and the family take the animals with them on a ship to Canada. On the way, there is a terrible storm and the ship sinks. Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a hyena, zebra, orang-utan and a tiger. When he sees the animals, Pi is scared and he jumps into the ocean. Then he remembers there are sharks in the ocean and he climbs back into the lifeboat. Sadly, Pi’s family and the ship’s sailors die in the storm. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other, till only Pi and the tiger are left alive. Luckily for Pi, there is some food and water on the lifeboat, but he soon needs to start catching fish. He feeds the fish to the tiger to stop it killing and eating him. He also uses a whistle and his knowledge of animals from the zoo to control the tiger.', 'Pi and the tiger spend 227 days in the lifeboat. They live through terrible storms and are burnt by the Pacific sun. They are often hungry and ill. Sometimes, Pi is happy and hopeful, but sometimes he feels sad and lonely. Finally, they arrive at the coast of Mexico, but you will have to read the book to find out what happens in the end!', 'Three teenagers give their opinions on The Life of Pi.', ""I think it’s an excellent book and I couldn’t stop reading it. In one chapter, Pi is in the lifeboat and he sings 'Happy Birthday' to his mother on the day of her birthday, even though he thinks she is dead. It was a very sad moment and I wanted to cry.Alex, 15"", 'I didn’t like this book because it’s very slow and boring. In some chapters, there isn’t any action and we only read about what Pi is thinking.Danny, 16 ', 'What a fascinating book! I enjoyed the story, but I also learnt so much about animals and surviving at sea. It’s a book for everyone to enjoy, old and young, men and women.Paula, 18', 'Robin Newton']"|"['The Life of Pi tells the story of Pi, a teenage boy from India, who finds himself trapped in a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a tiger.

It is the third book by the Canadian author Yann Martel, and was published in 2001. Since then, it has sold over seven million copies worldwide, won several prizes and been translated into 41 languages. Martel is the son of a diplomat and as a child lived in Costa Rica, Canada, France and Mexico. After finishing university in Canada, he spent two years travelling round India and then decided to devote himself to writing.', 'In the first part of the book, we learn about Pi’s childhood in the city of Pondicherry in India. His father owns and runs the city zoo and the family home is in the zoo complex. When they aren’t at school, Pi and his brother help out at the zoo. Here, Pi comes to appreciate the beauty of nature and learns a lot about animal psychology and behaviour.', ""Religion is important to Pi too. Though his family is Hindu, he is curious about other religions and he makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. To everyone’s surprise, Pi declares himself to be simultaneously Hindu, Muslim and Christian. When his family and teachers ask him to choose just one religion, Pi refuses, saying 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, his family and teachers decide to let him make his own mind up about religion."", 'When Pi is 16, a new government is elected that his parents don’t support. Worried about the future, Pi’s parents decide to close the zoo and emigrate to Canada. Some of the animals are sold to zoos in North America and the family travel by ship to Canada taking the animals with them. On the way, there is a terrible storm and the ship sinks. Tragically, Pi’s family and the ship’s sailors all drown, but Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a hyena, zebra, orang-utan and an enormous tiger. At first, Pi is terrified of the animals and jumps into the ocean. Then he remembers that there are hungry sharks in the water around him and realises his only option is to climb back into the lifeboat. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other, till only Pi and the tiger are left. Fortunately for Pi, the tiger, who he names Richard Parker, is seasick and has no immediate interest in eating him.', 'As time goes by and it becomes clear that no ships or helicopters have been sent to rescue survivors, Pi decides to use his knowledge of animal psychology to stop Richard Parker attacking him. Using eye contact, a whistle and rocking the boat to make the tiger seasick, he sets out to show Richard Parker that he is the dominant animal on the lifeboat despite the tiger’s far superior strength. Pi discovers a supply of food and water on the boat, but soon he needs to start catching fish to keep himself and Richard Parker fed.', 'Pi and Richard Parker spend 227 days in the lifeboat. They live through hunger, illness and exhaustion. They endure violent storms and the burning heat of the Pacific sun, but somehow they survive. At times, Pi finds comfort in his three religions, but at other times he is overcome with loneliness and despair. Finally, the Mexican coast appears on the horizon and everything changes. It would be a shame to give away the ending, so you will have to read the book yourself to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker once land is in sight.', ""It’s a great book and I couldn’t stop reading it, but I didn’t want it to end either!

She was waiting outside the classroom when her friend Tara arrived.', '“Hi Amy! Your mum sent me a text. You forgot your inhaler. Why don’t you turn your phone on?” Amy didn’t like technology. She never sent text messages and she hated Facebook too.', '“Did Kamal ask you to the disco?” Tara was Amy’s best friend, and she wanted to know everything that was happening in Amy’s life. “I don’t think he likes me,” said Amy. “And I never see him alone. He’s always with Grant.” Amy and Tara didn’t like Grant.', '“Do you know about their art project?” asked Amy. “It’s about graffiti, I think,” said Tara. “They’re working on it at the old house behind the factory.” “But that building is dangerous,” said Amy. “Aah, are you worried he’s going to get hurt?"" Tara teased. “Shut up, Tara! Hey look, here they come!”', 'Kamal and Grant arrived. “Hi Kamal!” said Tara. “Are you going to the Halloween disco tomorrow?” “Yes. Hi Amy,” Kamal said, smiling. “Do you want to come and see our paintings after school?” “I’m coming too!” Tara insisted.', 'After school, Kamal took the girls to the old house. It was very old and very dirty too. There was rubbish everywhere. The windows were broken and the walls were damp. It was scary. Amy didn’t like it. There were paintings of zombies and skeletons on the walls. “We’re going to take photos for the school art competition,” said Kamal. Amy didn’t like it but she didn’t say anything. “Where’s Grant?” asked Tara. “Er, he’s buying more paint.” Kamal looked away quickly. Tara thought he looked suspicious. “It’s getting dark, can we go now?” said Amy. She didn’t like zombies.', 'Then, they heard a loud noise coming from a cupboard in the corner of the room. “What’s that?” Amy was frightened. “I didn’t hear anything,” said Kamal. Something was making strange noises. There was something inside the cupboard. “Oh no! What is it?” Amy was very frightened now. “What do you mean? There’s nothing there!” Kamal was trying not to smile. Suddenly the door opened with a bang and a zombie appeared, shouting and moving its arms. Amy screamed and covered her eyes. “Oh very funny, Grant!” said Tara looking bored. Kamal and Grant started laughing. “Ha ha, you were frightened!” said Grant. ""Do you like my zombie costume?” Amy took Tara’s arm. “I can’t breathe,” she said. Kamal looked worried now. “Is she OK? It was only a joke.” “No she’s not OK, you idiot. She’s having an asthma attack and she forgot her inhaler.” Tara took out her phone. “I’m calling her dad.”', 'Next evening was Halloween. The girls were at the school disco. “Are you better now?” asked Tara. “I’m fine,” said Amy. “I think it was the smell of paint that started the attack.” Tara looked around. “So, where are the zombies?” “I don’t know, I don’t want to see Kamal again,” said Amy. “Come on, let’s dance!”', 'Amy and Tara were dancing when Grant arrived, looking worried. “Hi, someone stole my phone. Have you seen Kamal? He said he was coming here at eight o’clock. Can you phone him?” “Go away, idiot!” Tara didn’t stop dancing. Grant looked upset. “Tell him I’m looking for him,” he called as he left the disco. Tara really didn’t like Grant.', 'Just then, Tara’s phone rang. She looked at it. “Ha!” she said, “I don’t believe it!” “What is it?” asked Amy. “Kamal just sent a text to everyone. Listen!” Tara read out Kamal’s message.', '“I’m at the house. I can’t move. Please call an ambulance. My battery is running out.”', 'The girls didn’t stop dancing. Lots of their friends saw Kamal’s message too, but Tara told everyone it was just a joke. They all ignored it.', 'The next morning, Amy’s mum and dad were listening to the radio. “Is Amy up yet?” Dad asked. “No, she’s tired,” said mum, turning the volume up on the radio.', '“This morning, police are investigating the death of a sixteen-year-old boy. He died last night in a disused house on Moortown Road...”', 'Dad put down his newspaper. “But that’s where Amy went with her friends.”', '“...They found the body early this morning.

She was waiting outside the art class when her friend Tara arrived.', '“Hi Amy! Your mum texted me. You forgot your inhaler and your phone’s switched off again!” Amy wasn’t good with technology. She never sent text messages and she didn’t have a Facebook account either.', '“So, did he ask you to the disco then?” Amy wished she hadn’t told Tara about her feelings for Kamal. Tara was Amy’s best friend and she thought that gave her the right to know everything about Amy’s life. “I don’t think he’s interested,” said Amy. “Anyway, you can never see him on his own. He’s always with Grant.” Neither of them liked Grant.', '“Have you heard about their art project?” asked Amy. “Yes, it’s something to do with graffiti, I think,” said Tara. “They’ve been working on it at that abandoned house behind the factory.” “But isn’t that really dangerous?” asked Amy. “Aah, are you worried your boyfriend’s going to get hurt?” Tara teased. “Shut up! Hey look, here they come now!”', 'Kamal and Grant walked over, whispering to each other. “Hi Kamal!” said Tara, ignoring Grant. “Are you going to the Halloween disco tomorrow?” “Maybe. Hi Amy,” Kamal said, smiling. “Do you want to come up to the house and see our graffiti project after school?” Tara elbowed Amy. “I’m coming too!” she insisted.', 'After school that day, Kamal took the girls to the abandoned house. No one had lived there for years. There was rubbish everywhere. The windows were broken and there was mould on the walls. It was creepy and Amy didn’t like it. The boys had cleared the rubbish out of one room and the walls were covered in paintings of zombies and skeletons. “We’re going to take photos and enter them in the school competition,” said Kamal proudly. Amy didn’t seem impressed. “Very nice,” she said sarcastically. “Where’s Grant?” asked Tara. “Er, he’s gone to buy paint.” Kamal looked away quickly. “Aaah, have you two had a fight, then?” Tara jeered. “It’s getting dark,” said Amy. “Can we go now?” She had had enough of zombies for one day.', 'Just then, they heard a loud groaning noise coming from a cupboard in the corner of the room. “What was that?” Amy looked frightened. “I didn’t hear anything,” said Kamal. Something started banging against the door and moaning in a low voice. Someone or something was behind the door. “Oh no! What is it?” Amy was trembling now. “What are you talking about? There’s nothing!” Kamal was trying not to smile when the door suddenly burst open and a horrible, bloodstained zombie appeared, moaning and waving its arms. Amy screamed and covered her eyes. “Oh, very funny, Grant!” said Tara, looking bored. Kamal and Grant started giggling. “Ha ha, I scared you!” Grant laughed, very happy with himself. Tara turned to Amy to suggest leaving and noticed her friend was having trouble breathing. Kamal looked worried now. “Is she OK? We were only joking.” “No she’s not OK, you idiot. She’s having an asthma attack and she hasn’t got her inhaler.” Tara took out her phone. “I’m calling her dad.”', 'The next evening was Halloween. The girls were at the school disco. “Are you sure you’re OK now?” asked Tara. “I’m fine,” said Amy. “It wasn’t a serious attack. I think it was the paint fumes that started it.” Tara looked around. “So, where are the zombies?” “Who cares?” Amy said. “I don’t want to see Kamal again. Come on, let’s dance!”', 'Amy and Tara were having a great time when Grant arrived, looking worried. “Hi, my phone has been stolen. Have you seen Kamal? He told me to meet him here. Can you phone him?” “Get lost, idiot!” Tara turned away and didn’t stop dancing. Grant looked hurt. “Tell him I’m looking for him if you see him,” he called as he left. Tara really didn’t like Grant.', 'Just then Tara’s phone beeped and she looked at the screen. “Ha!” she said, “I don’t believe it!” “What?” Amy asked. “Kamal just sent a text. Listen to this!” Tara read Kamal’s text.', '“I’m at the house. I’m trapped. Please help. My battery is running out. Call an ambulance.”', 'The girls continued dancing. Lots of their friends had seen Kamal’s text too, but Tara told everyone to ignore it. It was just another one of his jokes.', 'The next morning, Amy’s mum and dad were listening to the news on the radio while they were having breakfast. “Is Amy up yet?” Dad asked. “No, today’s a holiday and she didn’t get back home from the disco until midnight,” said Mum, turning the volume up on the radio.', '“This morning, police are asking if anyone has information about the tragic death of a sixteen-year-old schoolboy last night in an abandoned house on Moortown Road...”', 'Dad put down his newspaper and looked at the radio. “But that’s where Amy went with her friends on Monday.”', '“...The boy, who died from loss of blood, was discovered early this morning partly buried under a pile of rubble and has been identified as Kamal Naseer...”', 'Brendan Dunne']|['Amy normally hated Monday mornings, but this term had been different. Kamal had joined her art class in September and she certainly didn’t hate Kamal; in fact, quite the opposite. She was waiting outside the art class when her friend Tara arrived.', '“Hi Amy! Your mum just texted me. She says you forgot your inhaler again and why don’t you switch your phone on?” Amy wasn’t a big fan of technology. She hated sending text messages and didn’t have a Facebook account either.', '“So, did he ask you to the disco, then?” Not for the first time, Amy wished she hadn’t told Tara about her feelings for Kamal. She knew Tara wouldn’t tell anyone else. It was just that Tara was Amy’s best friend and she seemed to think that gave her the right to know everything that was going on in Amy’s life. “I don’t think he’s interested anyway,” said Amy. “Besides, it’s not like you ever see him on his own. He’s always hanging out with Grant.” Neither of them liked Grant.', '“What’s this art project they’re doing together, then?” asked Amy. “Oh, it’s something to do with graffiti, I think,” said Tara. “They’ve been working on it at that old abandoned house behind the factory after school.” “But that’s a ruin!” said Amy. “Isn’t it dangerous?” “Aah, are you worried lover boy’s going to get hurt?” Tara teased. “Shut up, Tara! Hey look, here they come now!”', 'Kamal and Grant walked over, whispering to each other. “Hi Kamal!” said Tara, ignoring Grant. “Are you going to the Halloween disco tomorrow?” “Yeah, maybe. Hi Amy,” Kamal said, smiling. “Do you want to come up to the house and see our graffiti project after school?” “Ow!” Amy gave Tara a pained look. “Stop elbowing me!” “I’m coming too!” Tara insisted.', 'After school that day, Kamal took Amy and Tara up to the abandoned house. No one had lived there for years. There were piles of rubbish in the corners and weeds growing everywhere. The windows were broken and the walls were covered with mould. It was definitely creepy. Amy didn’t like it there. The boys had been working in one of the downstairs rooms. They had cleared the rubbish out and the walls were covered in lurid paintings of zombies and skeletons. “We’re going to take photos and enter them in the school competition,” said Kamal proudly. Amy didn’t look too impressed. “Very nice,” she said sarcastically. “Where’s Grant, then?” asked Tara. “Er, he’s gone to get more paint.” Kamal looked away quickly. “Aaah, have you two had a quarrel, then?” Tara jeered. “I don’t like it here, and it’s getting dark.” Amy had had enough of zombies for one day. “Can we go now?”', 'Just then, they heard a loud groaning noise coming from a cupboard in the corner of the room. “What was that?” Amy sounded frightened. “I didn’t hear anything.” said Kamal. Something started banging and scraping against the door and moaning in a low voice. Someone or something was trying to get out. “Oh no! What is it?” Amy was trembling now. “What are you talking about? There’s nothing!” Kamal was trying not to smile when the door suddenly burst open and a horrific, bloodstained zombie lurched into the room, moaning and waving its arms. Amy screamed and covered her eyes. “Oh, very funny, Grant!” said Tara looking bored. Kamal and Grant started giggling uncontrollably. “Ha ha, got you!” laughed Grant, very pleased with himself. Tara turned to Amy to suggest leaving and it was then she noticed her friend was leaning against the wall gasping for breath. Kamal looked worried now. “Is she OK? We were only having a laugh.” “No she’s not OK, you idiot. She’s having an asthma attack and she hasn’t got her inhaler.” Tara reached for her phone. “I’m calling her dad”', 'The next evening was Halloween.

Have you two seen Kamal? He was supposed to be here ages ago. Can you give him a call?” “Get lost, loser!” Tara turned away and carried on dancing. Grant gave her a pained look and left. “Tell him I’m looking for him if you see him,” he called over his shoulder. Tara really didn’t like Grant.', 'Just then Tara’s phone beeped and she looked at the screen. “Ha!” she said, “I’m not falling for that!” “What is it?” asked Amy. “Kamal just sent a text.

wheres-roxy-level|"[""When Chloe arrives home from school, she always makes a cup of coffee and then goes upstairs to her bedroom. This is her favourite time of day. The house is quiet and she can play with her pet rats. Yes, that's right, pet rats! Chloe has got two of them. Their names are Zena and Roxy and they live in a cage in Chloe's bedroom. Chloe knows that most people don't like rats or they think rats are dirty. A year ago, Chloe didn't like rats either. Then, one day, her friend Martin showed Chloe his pet rats and Chloe saw how intelligent and affectionate they are."", ""'If you can have cats, dogs or hamsters as pets, then why not rats?' she thought. When one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe asked her mum if she could have two pet rats for her birthday present. Her mum and dad didn't like the idea, but then Chloe got an excellent school report and they decided to give Chloe the present she wanted."", ""'There’s one very important rule,' said Chloe's mum. 'The rats live in your bedroom and they never go to other rooms, especially not the kitchen!'"", ""In her room, Chloe opened the cage. First she picked up Roxy and put her on the floor. Then she picked up Zena and put her on her shoulder. Roxy loved to explore. She climbed furniture and went under Chloe's bed. Zena was quieter and liked sitting on Chloe's shoulder while Chloe sent messages to her friends or read a book."", ""Someone knocked on the door. 'Hi, Chloe,' called Mum. 'Are you there?' 'Yes, Mum,' said Chloe. 'Come in.' 'I'm going to my aerobics class. I'll be back at seven o'clock. Dad's on his way home. He's making pasta tonight.' 'OK, Mum. See you later', Chloe replied."", ""Mum closed the door. Chloe put Zena back in the cage and called for Roxy. 'Roxy?' said Chloe. 'Roxy, where are you?' Roxy usually came when Chloe said her name. Chloe started to look for her. Where could Roxy be? 'She must be here somewhere,' thought Chloe, 'but Mum was here and Mum opened the door! Oh no! Roxy could be in the bathroom or living room ... or even the kitchen!' Chloe started to search the house. First, she looked in her parents' room and the bathroom but Roxy wasn't there. Next, she went downstairs and looked in the kitchen. She opened cupboards and drawers, calling Roxy's name all the time. She looked under the table and behind the fridge. She looked in the washing machine too, but Roxy wasn't there. 'Hi, Chloe!' said Dad as he came into the kitchen with a bag of tomatoes and pasta. 'Are you OK?' he asked. 'Yes, I'm ... I'm ...' Chloe wanted to say 'I'm fine', but she wasn't fine and she needed Dad's help. 'Dad, I've ... I've ... I've lost Roxy!' she said. 'I see,' said Dad, putting down the shopping bag. 'Don't worry, we'll find her. She can't be far!' Chloe and her dad looked all over the house but they couldn't find Roxy anywhere. Chloe went upstairs to look in her room for the third time. Then, she heard a key in the door and Mum calling, 'It's me, I'm home'."", ""'Oh, no!' thought Chloe. 'Mum's going to be angry!' She decided to stay in her room and wait for Dad to tell Mum about Roxy. Then Dad laughed and Mum called out, 'Chloe, come downstairs'."", ""Chloe went downstairs and there was Mum with a smile on her face and Roxy on her shoulder. 'Oh, Mum, you found her!' said Chloe. 'Where was she?' 'When I arrived at the gym,' said Mum, 'I opened my bag and found Roxy. She was sleeping in one of my shoes'. 'Oh, sorry, Mum. Are you angry?' asked Chloe. 'No, I'm not angry. I picked her up for the first time and do you know what? Now, I think I like rats too!'"", 'Robin Newton']"|"[""Chloe arrived home from school, made herself a cup of coffee and went to her bedroom. She had homework to do, but it could wait for later. She wanted to enjoy the quiet time before her parents arrived home and filled the house with the sounds of conversation, television and her dad's favourite jazz music."", ""She liked this time of day too because she could play with her pet rats. Yes, that's right, pet rats! Chloe has got two of them, Zena and Roxy. Chloe knows they're not typical pets and she knows most people think rats are dirty. She didn't like rats either till her friend Martin invited her to his house one day and showed her his pet rats. When she played with them and held a rat in her hands for the first time, she saw how affectionate and intelligent they were. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to take two of them. It wasn't easy to persuade Mum and Dad. But fortunately, a good school report arrived just before Chloe's birthday and her parents were in a good mood. When Mum asked Chloe what she wanted for her birthday, Chloe told her she'd like a pair of rats. 'Rats? Are you serious?' asked Mum, and then Chloe told her about Martin and the baby rats. 'Give me five minutes,' said Chloe’s mum. 'I'm going to phone Martin's parents.' It had been the longest five minutes of Chloe's life, but finally Mum came back into the kitchen, smiled and said, 'Yes, alright. You can have two rats, but ...' (with mothers, there's always a 'but'!) '... they must live in your room and can never go to other parts of the house, especially not the kitchen'."", ""Chloe was delighted, and two days later they went to Martin's house to collect Roxy and Zena. In her room, Chloe opened the cage. First she picked up Roxy and put her on the floor. Then she picked up Zena and put her on her shoulder. Roxy loved to explore. She climbed bookcases and drawers and went under Chloe's bed. Zena was quieter and liked sitting on Chloe's shoulder while she messaged her friends or read a book. A while later, there was a knock at the door. 'Hi, Chloe,' called Mum. 'Are you there?' 'Yes, Mum,' said Chloe. 'Come in.' 'I'm going to my aerobics class. I'll be back about seven o'clock. Dad's on his way home. He's making pasta tonight.' 'OK, Mum. See you later', Chloe replied."", ""Mum closed the door. Chloe put Zena back in her cage and called for Roxy. 'Roxy?' said Chloe. 'Roxy, where are you?' Roxy usually came when Chloe said her name. Chloe waited a moment and then started to look for her. Where could Roxy be? She must be in Chloe's room somewhere. Then Chloe remembered that Mum had opened the door. Roxy might have gone out of the room then and now she could be anywhere in the house. Chloe started to search. She looked in her parents' room and the bathroom but Roxy wasn't there. Next, she went downstairs. On the way, she had a sudden panic. What if Roxy had climbed into the washing machine? And what if Mum had turned it on with Roxy inside? Chloe ran the last few steps to the kitchen and was happy to see the washing machine door was open and Roxy wasn't inside. Then Chloe searched the kitchen, opening drawers and cupboards, calling Roxy's name the whole time. 'Hi, Chloe!' said Dad as he came into the kitchen with a bag of food from the Italian Delicatessen. 'Are you OK?' he asked. 'Yes, I'm ... I'm ...' Chloe wanted to say 'I'm fine', but she wasn't fine and she needed Dad's help. 'Dad, I've ... I've ... I've lost Roxy!' she said.

Yes, that's right, pet rats! Chloe has got two of them, Zena and Roxy. Chloe knows they're not typical pets and she has lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain to people that rats aren't dirty and they make fantastic pets if you look after them correctly.

She looked in her parents' room and the bathroom, but she couldn't see Roxy anywhere. Then she headed downstairs to the kitchen, hoping she'd find Roxy munching on a carrot or snacking on crumbs. Then she had a sudden panic. What if Roxy had climbed into the washing machine? And what if Mum had turned it on before she went out? Chloe ran the last few steps to the kitchen and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the washing machine door was open with no sign of Roxy inside. Chloe then searched the rest of the kitchen, looking in drawers and opening cupboards, calling Roxy's name as she did so. 'Hi, Chloe!' said Dad's voice and she turned around to see him coming into the kitchen with a bag of food from the Italian Delicatessen. 'Are you OK?' he asked. 'Yes, I'm ... I'm ...' Chloe had to make a decision fast. Was she going to tell Dad about Roxy or was she going to pretend that everything was fine? Different voices spoke inside her head. 'He'll be furious!' said one voice. 'He might help!' said another, so Chloe decided to take a chance. 'Dad, I've ... well, I've lost Roxy,” said Chloe, trying not to look Dad in the eye. 'I see,' said Dad, putting down the shopping bag, and already beginning to scan the kitchen for the sight of a nose and whiskers or a long pink tail. 'Don't worry, we'll find her. She can't be far away!' Chloe and her dad spent a frantic half hour looking all over the house for Roxy. When she was searching her room for the third time, Chloe heard a key in the door and Mum calling, 'It's me, I'm home'. 'Oh, no!' thought Chloe.

He found a website called YouTube and watched a video of another teenager like him. The teenager was sitting in his bedroom and talking about how bored he was. “I can do better than that!” thought Charlie. So he used his laptop and webcam to make his first video, and posted it on YouTube under the name Charlieissocoollike.', 'YouTube started in 2005 and is now the world’s largest video website. More than 3 billion videos are watched every day on YouTube and a large number of those are video blogs. These are simply videos of people talking to a camera about their lives or things that interest them.', 'Two days after Charlie posted his first video, he had 150 subscribers, so he decided to make more videos. He soon became quite popular. A few months later, Oprah Winfrey, the famous American TV host, showed one of his videos called How to be English on her programme. In this video, Charlie wears a suit and tie and talks in a funny accent. He shows viewers how to make a cup of tea. Charlie suddenly became very famous in the United States too.', 'To say thank you to all his fans he made a video called Challenge Charlie, asking people to suggest funny or difficult things for him to do in his videos. Challenges included drinking tomato ketchup, wearing all of his clothes at once and painting himself purple!', 'Charlie is also a singer and songwriter. His most popular videos are of him singing and playing the ukelele. In Duet with Myself, he uses special effects to sing a duet with himself about what a boring person he is. This has now been watched over 7 million times!', 'Charlie’s best friend, Alex Day, is also a musician and video blogger. They met through YouTube and started a band together. The band is called Chameleon Circuit, and they have made two CDs and performed several concerts.', 'With more than one and a half million subscribers, Charlie is the most popular video blogger in the UK. He has now made enough money to buy a house with his friend Alex. But what is the secret of his success? “I make the kind of videos that I want to watch,” he says. And when asked how fame has affected him, Charlie says, ""I still sit in my bedroom talking to my camera, and that\'s what I want to do.""', 'Oh, and how did Charlie do in his exams back in 2007? Well, he passed with nine A grades and one B! He says that he wants to go to university in the future but decided to try and make a career on YouTube before that. So, far, it’s going very well!', 'Brendan Dunne']"|"['In April 2007, a 16-year-old boy named Charlie McDonnell was studying for his exams.

But he was bored, so he turned on his computer and started surfing the web. He soon found a website called YouTube and within minutes he was watching a video of another teenager sitting in his bedroom in the United States, talking to his computer about how bored he was. “I could do better than that!” thought Charlie. So, using a cheap laptop computer and webcam that his dad had bought for him, he made his first video blog and posted it on YouTube under the name Charlieissocoollike.', 'YouTube started in 2005 and is now the world’s largest video sharing website with hundreds of millions of users. There are over 3 billion videos viewed every day on the site, and 48 hours of video uploaded every minute. A very high proportion of the videos on YouTube are video blogs, which are just videos of people talking to a camera about their lives or things that interest them. That might sound boring, but in fact video blogging is now becoming more popular with teenagers than television!', 'Back in April 2007, a few days after Charlie had posted his first video, he was very surprised to find that he had 150 subscribers. Encouraged by this, he went on to make more videos. A month later, he posted a video called How to get featured on YouTube. The people at YouTube liked this and put it on their UK homepage. They weren’t the only ones to like it. Two days later Charlie’s audience had grown to 4,400 and he started to get hundreds of video messages from fans. “It was really strange,” says Charlie. “I’d been talking to my computer for a month, and suddenly my computer started talking back to me!”', 'His next big success came a few months later when Oprah Winfrey, the famous American TV host, showed one of Charlie’s comedy videos called How to be English on her show.

Charlie realised he could use his fame to help people less fortunate than himself. To celebrate his 18th birthday, he raised £5,000 for cancer research by shaving all his hair off on live TV. Topping that, in 2010 he raised more than four times as much when he teamed up with fellow YouTuber Myles Dyer to co-present a live show on the Internet.

But then he visits a school with his mum, he likes the headteacher and decides to go. Auggie’s first year at school has good times and bad times. Auggie makes some good friends but other children are horrible to him. At the end of the year, Auggie goes on a school trip and a frightening event there changes things completely.', 'Wonder is an excellent book. It tells an inspiring story that makes you feel many different emotions. Once I started reading it, I didn’t want to stop. It is easy to like Auggie. He has a good sense of humour, so the book has a good mix of funny and sad moments. But the book isn’t just about Auggie. We learn what life is like for his sister, and Jack, who is Auggie’s friend. Wonder is a book about a ten-year old boy, but it’s popular with people of all ages. Pre-teens, teenagers and adults all love Wonder.', 'Wonder is RJ Palacio’s first book. On her website, she explains that she had the idea for Wonder after seeing a girl with deformities on the street one day. Many schools are using the book to start discussions about bullying, friendship and being different. The book is very popular and has won prizes.
