walk-forest-level|"[""Going through the forest is my favourite part of the walk. My dog Benji loves it too. I’m Grace. I live on a farm with my parents and I take Benji for a walk most days after school. While Benji’s playing, I stop to take a photo of a butterfly. I’m thinking about posting it on Facebook, but then I hear Benji barking. He’s jumping and running around a boy. The poor boy looks worried. 'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and throw him his ball. I’m about to say sorry to the boy, but he’s gone."", 'It’s cold today, so Benji and I are walking fast. As we go through the forest, it starts raining so I run. Suddenly, I fall and I’m on my back.

'I haven’t seen you at school. Do you live near here?' I ask. 'No, I’m from Manchester,' he says. 'Sorry! I have to go. Can you walk? Do you need help?' 'No, I’m fine. Thanks!' I say and the boy walks away. 'I’m Grace,' I call. 'What’s your name?' but he’s already gone. At home, Mum’s watching the news. 'Hi Grace. Do you know  about this boy, Mark?' she asks. 'No, what boy?' I say. 'A boy from Manchester. He’s run away from home. Look! This is his dad.' There’s a man on TV sitting with a policeman. He’s crying as the policeman asks people to help. Then they show a photo of the missing boy. It’s the boy from the forest. He’s Mark. Should I say something? 'Poor man,' says Mum. 'I just hope they find his son soon.' No, I mustn’t say anything. If I tell Mum, the police will come and find Mark. What if he’s run away for a good reason? I should talk to him first."", ""I can’t find Mark, so I shout, 'Mark, where are you?' No answer. 'Mark,' I shout again, 'I know about you.' After a moment, he appears. 'What do you know? How do you know my name?' 'Your dad was on TV. The police are looking for you.' He looks shocked. 'Did you say anything? Have you told them?' 'No,' I say. 'I wanted to talk to you first. What’s happened? Why have you run away?' 'I had an argument with my dad. A bad one.' 'What about?' I ask. Mark points to a fallen tree and we sit down. 'My mum died four years ago. It was a very difficult time for me and for Dad. He was sad for a long time, but then he met someone new. Mel’s her name.'

Have you talked to him?' 'He tells me to try harder with her, but I can’t. The night I ran away, he told me that we’re all moving to London. Mel’s from London, you see. Then he told me that he and Mel want to get married and have a baby. We both got angry and I told him I’m not moving to London. I took my tent and I left in the middle of the night.' 'But what will you do? You can’t live here.' I tell him. 'I know, but my grandad and my friends are in Manchester. I don’t want to move to London.' 'You might like London,' I say.

Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria is one of them. She is one of the world’s greatest climbers and has climbed all the world’s mountains over 8,000 metres. It’s very difficult to climb in cold weather and storms, but Gerlinde loves it. She started climbing as a teenager in the mountains near her home. When she left school she became a nurse but always went climbing in her free time. Now she spends her time climbing and helping a charity for poor children in Nepal.', 'Some adventurers are always looking for a new challenge. Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed mountains, ridden a bike across Canada and run races in the desert. But her most incredible journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole. As she skied, Meagan pulled a sledge with a tent and all her food. She skied through terrible storms and freezing temperatures for forty days till she arrived at the South Pole.

animals-city-level|['One night in December 2011, a bear came into the city of Vancouver in Canada. It walked through the city streets past houses, shops and offices. Then it found some food in bins outside a restaurant and started eating. In the morning, someone saw the bear and called the police. The police came with a vet from the city zoo. They put the bear in a lorry and took it to the mountains outside the city. Luckily, the bear was safe. But what happens in other countries when big animals come into cities? In Vancouver it is unusual to see a bear, but in some cities you can see big animals on the city streets every day. Big animals usually come into cities to find food. In Cape Town in South Africa baboons come into the city when they are hungry. They go into gardens and eat fruit from trees. They even go into houses and take food from cupboards and fridges! Baboons are strong animals and they can scare people. But the city can be dangerous for baboons too. Sometimes, cars and buses kill baboons in accidents. Human food is very bad for the baboons’ teeth because it has a lot of sugar. Now, there are Baboon Monitors working in Cape Town. Their job is to find baboons in the city and return them to the countryside. In Berlin in Germany, pigs sometimes come into the city to look for food. They eat flowers and plants in parks and gardens. Sometimes they eat vegetables from gardens and they walk in the street and cause accidents. Some people like the pigs and they give them food and water to drink. Other people do not like the pigs and they want the government and the police to stop them entering the city. In Moscow in Russia, there are 35,000 wild dogs. The dogs live in parks, old houses, markets and train stations. Some dogs live in groups and others live alone. Many people in Moscow like the dogs. They give them food and water. Some people make small houses for the dogs in their gardens. This helps the dogs in winter, when the temperature in Moscow is -10 ºC and there is a lot of snow and ice. Many animals live in cities. In some cities, you can see birds, insects, mice and squirrels every day. But sometimes, it is dangerous when big animals come into cities to find food. We need to find ways of stopping animals coming into the city without hurting them.', 'Robin Newton']|"[""Recently, there have been many reports in newspapers and on TV about big animals coming into towns and cities. There have been bears in Vancouver parks, leopards on the streets of Mumbai and wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when big animals come into our cities? Is it a good thing or is it dangerous for us and the animals? Wild animals usually come into cities to look for food. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons sometimes come into the suburbs. They eat fruit from gardens and go into people's kitchens and take food from cupboards and fridges! Baboons are strong animals and sometimes they scare children and fight with pet dogs. Many people do not like them, but the city can be dangerous for baboons too. Sometimes, baboons are hurt in car accidents and the sugar in human food can be very bad for their teeth. The city council in Cape Town has a team of Baboon Monitors. Their job is to find baboons in the city and take them back to the countryside. This makes the city safer for people and it is healthier for the baboons. The problem is that a lot of baboons will come back to the city to find food again. In Berlin in Germany, groups of wild pigs sometimes come into the city to look for food. Pigs have come into the city for hundreds of years, but now the winters are warmer, there are more pigs than in the past. Pigs eat flowers and plants and dig in gardens and parks in the city. They also walk in the street and cause traffic accidents. Some city residents like the pigs and give them food. But the city council is worried about the traffic accidents. They have told people to stop giving the pigs food and have put up fences to stop the pigs entering the city.  In Moscow in Russia, there are 35,000 wild dogs. They live in parks, empty houses, markets and train stations. Some of the dogs were pets that people did not want so they left them on the streets. Others were born on the streets and have always lived there. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs (a pack is the name for a group of dogs). In 2010, scientists studied the dogs. They found some very interesting facts:"", 'What do the people in Moscow think of the dogs? A lot of people like them and are used to seeing them on the streets. They give the dogs food and water to drink. The winter in Moscow is very cold with lots of snow and temperatures of -10 ºC. It can be hard for dogs to survive but some city residents have built small huts for the dogs to live in during the winter. Mice, squirrels and birds often live in cities and survive. Some bigger animals like the dogs in Moscow can survive in the city too, with a little help from their human friends. For many big animals, cities are dangerous places and they need our help to return to the countryside.', 'Robin Newton']"|"[""Small animals like birds, squirrels, mice and insects are a common sight in many cities and towns. But in recent years, the world's press has been full of reports of wild animals coming into cities in bigger and bigger numbers. There have been bears in Vancouver parks, leopards on the streets of Mumbai and wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Are they welcome or are they considered a danger or a pest? Often wild animals come into cities to look for food. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons have started coming into residential areas on the edge of the city to feed. They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and orchards. Some brave baboons have even come into people's houses and taken food from kitchen cupboards and fridges! Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence. The city can be a dangerous place for baboons too. Some have been injured or killed in car accidents and others have been electrocuted as they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species and to save them and minimise conflicts between humans and baboons, the city council has employed a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food. In Berlin in Germany, groups of wild pigs often come into the suburbs to look for food. They dig up parks and gardens looking for roots, fungi, insects and other small animals to eat. Apart from damage to parks and gardens, the pigs have also caused several traffic accidents as they are slow to move off roads when cars are approaching. In spite of this, some city residents welcome the pigs and have been giving them food. They argue that pigs have been coming into the city for centuries and that people should learn to live with them. This attitude was not shared by the city council. Their first reaction was to employ a group of hunters to shoot young pigs. Many city residents complained that this was unnecessarily cruel and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers. In response to protests, the city council decided to take more peaceful action against pigs. Instead of shooting them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past. One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, there are approximately 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some of the dogs were born wild, while others are pets that have been abandoned by their owners. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and found that the dogs have adapted remarkably successfully to urban life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs appear to understand traffic lights. Dogs that live in packs have learnt that humans are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs so those dogs are sent to beg for food for the whole pack. Some dogs have even learnt to use the city's metro system to get from one part of their territory to another! Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their excellent sense of smell and have learnt to recognise the scents of their favourite destinations. Another possibility is that they have learnt to recognise the names of stations they hear in announcements. Either way, metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals. Many city residents have grown fond of the dogs. Some people feed them and others have built shelters to help the dogs survive the brutally cold Moscow winters. Some animals, like the dogs in Moscow, have adapted very well to city life. For others, the city is a dangerous place and it is difficult for animals to live in harmony with humans. It would be a shame to hurt or kill animals when they come into cities to look for food. Hopefully, city councils, conservationists and city residents can work together and find imaginative ways to keep bigger animals out of cities without harming them."", 'Robin Newton']"

good-night-stories-rebel-girls-book-review-level|['We all know how fairy tales go. A beautiful girl waits for a prince to find her. Then she gets married to him and becomes a princess. But what if the girl was clever or strong instead of beautiful? What if she wanted to be an astronaut, a politician or a pirate instead of a princess? And what if she didn’t need a prince to do it? That’s the idea behind the book Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls. It’s a book of fairy tales with a difference: all the stories are true. The book tells the stories of one hundred amazing women from 1500 BC to today. But, the stories aren’t just boring biographies. Instead, they’re like fairy tales. You probably won’t know the names of most of the women but, when you finish reading, you’ll ask yourself why. Sometimes, it’s because people tried to remove them from history. Like Hatshepsut, one of the most important queens of Egypt. After she died, some men broke her statues and removed her name from documents. Other times, it’s because a man’s name became more famous. For example, Charles Babbage is called the ‘father of computers’ but a woman, Ada Lovelace, wrote the first computer program. Why haven’t we learned about these women before? Often history remembers men more than women. If you close your eyes and think of a war hero and a pilot, you probably think of men. If you read the book, those pictures might start to become women of all colours and ages. The women in the book did things because they wanted to and they didn’t listen when people told them not to. One problem with the book, unfortunately, is its name, because it gives the idea it’s a book for girls. It’s a great idea to show young girls what women can do. But the stories are also interesting for boys to read. And it’s also important that boys can think of women in jobs like doctor, Formula One race car driver and president. Not all the women included are ‘good girls’. One woman, Jingū, Empress of Japan, decided to start a war with Korea because of a dream. Is it a problem that the book doesn’t say that was a bad thing? Another example is pirates. The two women pirates in the book are unusual heroes because pirates were dangerous and they killed other people. It’s good to see a variety of women but why not show a bad ending to their story sometimes? We can understand that just because they’re female, they’re not always good people. You could read one story every night but you probably won’t want to stop with one. If you finish quickly, don’t worry because there are now two Rebel Girls books. The writers, Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, found the money to make both books from crowdfunding on Kickstarter. In 2016 they got one million dollars from 13,454 people from 75 countries. For the second book, in 2017, they did it again. This time they found another $866,000. The first book sold a million copies in 36 different languages and the second book will probably do the same.

It’s a book of fairy tales with a difference: all the stories are true.', 'The book tells the stories of one hundred inspiring women from 1500 BC in the time of Ancient Egypt to the modern day. The magic of the book is in the way it is written. It’s not just boring biographies but it’s told in the style of fairy tales. Some of the stories begin ‘Once upon a time’ just like a traditional fairy tale. They paint a picture of the life, dreams and achievements of each of the women and girls.', 'You probably won’t recognise the names of most of the women but, by the time you finish reading, you’ll wonder why. Sometimes, it’s because people tried to remove them from history. Like Hatshepsut, one of the most successful pharaohs of Egypt. She brought peace and money to Egypt for 25 years. But after her death, her name was removed from government documents – and some of her statues were destroyed – by men who came after her. Other times, it’s because a man’s name became more famous. For example, Charles Babbage is called the ‘father of computers’ but a woman, Ada Lovelace, wrote the first computer program.', 'For many of the others, it’s not obvious why we haven’t learned about these women before. Society has often rewarded and celebrated the achievements of men more than women. If you close your eyes and imagine a war hero, an architect and an explorer, the picture that comes into your mind is probably of men. If you read the book, you can start to replace those pictures with women of all colours and ages. These women fought for their rights, broke rules and refused to behave the way society expected them to.', 'One problem with the book, unfortunately, is the title because it suggests it’s a book for girls. It’s a great idea to celebrate and inspire young girls to show them how powerful they can be. But the stories are just as interesting for boys to read. And it’s just as important that boys imagine women as scientists, Formula One race car drivers and presidents.', 'Not all the women included are ‘good girls’. Margaret Thatcher’s story is a good example. She was Britain’s first female prime minister and it gives one example of why people liked her and one example of why people didn’t like her. But people didn’t like a lot of things Margaret Thatcher did and the book doesn’t make it clear that most people do not see her as a hero. Another woman, Jingū, Empress of Japan, decided to start a war with Korea because of a dream and the writers don’t make any comment about this either. Pirates too might seem unusual heroes. They were, after all, dangerous criminals. Although it’s good to see girls in a variety of roles, including politicians, pirates and invaders, it would be interesting to have a moral judgement sometimes. If these characters had a bad ending to their story or got what they deserved, it would show that just because they’re female, they’re not always good people.', 'There are now two Rebel Girls books after the first book sold a million copies in 36 different languages. The authors, Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, raised the money to make the first book from crowdfunding on Kickstarter in 2016. With the help of 13,454 people from 75 countries, they raised $1 million – the most money ever raised for an original book on Kickstarter. Readers wanted more, so the authors raised another $866,000. In 2017, they produced a second book with another hundred women’s stories.', 'Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls is the perfect book for reading a bit here and a bit there. But if you’re the kind of person who watches a whole series of a TV show in one weekend, you’ll probably do the same thing with this book.', 'Nicola Prentis']|"['We all know how fairy tales go.

You’ll read about a poet who published her first book at age 75, a ballet dancer who danced with her leg broken in six places and a woman from Kenya who planted 40 million trees with her friends.', 'If there’s any criticism of the book, it’s that its title makes it seem like a book for girls.

Skateboarding might be in the 2020 games!', 'Monica: “Go Skateboarding Day” started in 2004 when skateboarders in the United States decided it would be good to have a day that celebrates skateboarding. It takes place on the 21st of June every year. You can check it out online. It’s a day when there are events for skateboarders like competitions, parties, barbecues or people just go out and skate with their friends.', 'Carl: Fashions change, but at the moment, the fashion is for skaters to wear tight jeans or black trousers and a hooded top, T-shirt or check shirt. Baseball caps and woollen hats called beanies are popular too.', 'Monica: A lot of skateboarders, both boys and girls, have long hair too. But really skaters can wear what they want. For me, love of the sport is more important than someone’s clothes.', 'Monica: A long board is another type of skateboard, but it’s longer and it’s got bigger wheels. Standard skateboards are usually about 70 to 80 centimetres long, but long boards are 90 to 120 centimetres long. Long boards aren’t so good for jumps and tricks, but they are good for going fast along pavements.', 'Carl: Here’s an interesting fact about long boards. In 2006, a skateboarder went across Australia from Perth to Brisbane on a long board. That’s 5,850 kilometres!']

DanTDM went on a tour of America, Australia and the UK in 2017. Tickets sold out in minutes, with no advertising except Dan talking about the tour on YouTube. It’s not surprising if you think that Dan’s YouTube videos have been watched almost 11 billion times. Films and TV can’t even begin to compare with numbers as high as this.

It must be possible though, she thought, as the lady at the candyfloss stall handed her a huge, pink sugar cloud. She set herself a challenge. Tonight she was going to eat all of it.

They were just there, they’d always been there, and that was that. The tracks seemed to buzz as she walked. She could feel the vibration through her sandals and into her feet. And then she could hear it too. She stopped and it got stronger and louder. And then she heard a much louder sound, the screech of metal on metal. She looked behind her. A round light, small but getting bigger, was rushing towards her. It couldn’t be …', 'A train.', 'The wheels screeched louder against the rails as the driver braked. There was no way the train could stop before it reached her. Luckily, Claire lost her balance and fell to the right, off the track.

The tracks end in a couple of miles.', 'A man stuck his head out of the window of the engine and shouted, furious. ‘Don’t you know it’s dangerous on the tracks?’', '‘But … but … there aren’t any trains!’ Claire said, feeling stupid as the words came out of her mouth. There was clearly a train now, whatever had been true before. The train shouldn’t be, couldn’t be, there. It’s not real, she told herself.', '‘This isn’t real,’ she repeated out loud. But the heat coming from the engine certainly felt real enough.', '‘You can’t keep walking on the tracks, so you’re going to have to take the train the rest of the way.’', '‘No!’ Claire protested.', '‘Not scared, are you?’ he said. ‘If it isn’t real, what’s there to be scared of?’ It was what she had said to Peter.', 'She found herself climbing the metal stairs up to the train’s engine, candyfloss in hand.', '‘Sit.’ He pointed at a pile of wood as the train slowly started moving again.', '‘Where are we going?’ Claire asked.', '‘End of the line,’ he said.', '‘Oh, OK!’ Claire was relieved.

It is the third book by the Canadian author Yann Martel, and was published in 2001. Since then, it has sold over seven million copies worldwide, won several prizes and been translated into 41 languages. Martel is the son of a diplomat and as a child lived in Costa Rica, Canada, France and Mexico. After finishing university in Canada, he spent two years travelling round India and then decided to devote himself to writing.', 'In the first part of the book, we learn about Pi’s childhood in the city of Pondicherry in India. His father owns and runs the city zoo and the family home is in the zoo complex. When they aren’t at school, Pi and his brother help out at the zoo. Here, Pi comes to appreciate the beauty of nature and learns a lot about animal psychology and behaviour.', ""Religion is important to Pi too. Though his family is Hindu, he is curious about other religions and he makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. To everyone’s surprise, Pi declares himself to be simultaneously Hindu, Muslim and Christian. When his family and teachers ask him to choose just one religion, Pi refuses, saying 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, his family and teachers decide to let him make his own mind up about religion."", 'When Pi is 16, a new government is elected that his parents don’t support. Worried about the future, Pi’s parents decide to close the zoo and emigrate to Canada. Some of the animals are sold to zoos in North America and the family travel by ship to Canada taking the animals with them. On the way, there is a terrible storm and the ship sinks. Tragically, Pi’s family and the ship’s sailors all drown, but Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a hyena, zebra, orang-utan and an enormous tiger. At first, Pi is terrified of the animals and jumps into the ocean. Then he remembers that there are hungry sharks in the water around him and realises his only option is to climb back into the lifeboat. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other, till only Pi and the tiger are left. Fortunately for Pi, the tiger, who he names Richard Parker, is seasick and has no immediate interest in eating him.', 'As time goes by and it becomes clear that no ships or helicopters have been sent to rescue survivors, Pi decides to use his knowledge of animal psychology to stop Richard Parker attacking him. Using eye contact, a whistle and rocking the boat to make the tiger seasick, he sets out to show Richard Parker that he is the dominant animal on the lifeboat despite the tiger’s far superior strength. Pi discovers a supply of food and water on the boat, but soon he needs to start catching fish to keep himself and Richard Parker fed.', 'Pi and Richard Parker spend 227 days in the lifeboat. They live through hunger, illness and exhaustion. They endure violent storms and the burning heat of the Pacific sun, but somehow they survive. At times, Pi finds comfort in his three religions, but at other times he is overcome with loneliness and despair. Finally, the Mexican coast appears on the horizon and everything changes. It would be a shame to give away the ending, so you will have to read the book yourself to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker once land is in sight.', ""It’s a great book and I couldn’t stop reading it, but I didn’t want it to end either!

Auggie soon learns that his classmates don’t want to touch him for fear of catching 'the plague'. As he goes through the school year, Auggie goes through many intense ups and downs till finally an unexpected and traumatic event at a school camp changes things completely."", ""Wonder is a moving, inspiring and, at times, a very funny book. It’s also fast-paced and hard to put down once you get into it. I found myself getting the book out on the bus or in coffee shops, even when I only had time to read a couple of pages. It’s a book with wide appeal and is proving to be very popular with pre-teens, teenagers and adults alike. Auggie is a very likeable central character. He’s got a sense of humour and though readers will sympathise with him, I don’t think they’ll see him as a tragic character. More a regular kid who’s dealing with a world that’s not used to people who look different. One thing I really liked about the book is that it’s told from the point of view of different characters. We begin with Auggie, but then the story is told by his sister, Via, and his schoolmates till we come back to Auggie at the end. This works really well as we get to find out what it’s like for Via to have Auggie as a younger brother. We also learn what it’s like for Jack to be Auggie’s friend and how this means other kids don’t want to be his friend or that he can’t be in the 'popular group' at school."", 'Wonder is New Yorker RJ Palacio’s first novel. On her website, she explains that the idea for the book came to her after seeing a girl with facial deformities on the street one day. Wonder has been a bestseller in the United States and has already won several awards. Many schools are using it as a starting point for discussions about bullying, friendship and what it’s like to be different. A film version is being made, and many, including me, are waiting eagerly to see what RJ Palacio writes next.', 'Robin Newton']"
